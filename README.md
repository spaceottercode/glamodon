# Glamodon
User-Script that adds image filters, stickers, and image tweaking tools on Mastodon sites<sup>1</sup>

> 1. Stickers and tools will be made available soon.

Tested on Firefox running TamperMonkey. Not tested on Chrome (running natively as an extension).

# TODO/WIP

### filters

* the ability to scroll filters left and right
* the ability to add and remove filters
* the ability to reorder filters
* document how to make custom filters
* frames

### stickers

* adding stickers is a high priority. ideally should be extensible and distributable. 
  Simplest way is to allow any png (of limited size) to be imported as a sticker 
* Of lesser priority but nice to have, animated stickers

### tools

This is where you'll find things like the focal point tool and other tools like rotate (90ยบ)

* focal point
* rotate CW, CCW, flip
* brightness & contrast
* saturation
* curves, exposure, gamma
* color
* blurs
* text
